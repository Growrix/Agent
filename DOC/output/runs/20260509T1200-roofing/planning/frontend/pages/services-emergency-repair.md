## Forbidden Patterns

- Any hero media that uses warm or pastoral imagery — damage + dark sky reference only (or pure dark surface)
- Trust chips / testimonials buried below two full screens of content
- Animated countdown timers or pressure tactics (no "Respond in X minutes!" countdown clocks)
- Secondary informational content (blog links, related services) that delays the conversion path
- Identical dark surface treatment to `/services` overview (this page uses red-tinted dark, not pure slate)

---

## Visual Differentiation

- This is the ONLY page on the site with a red-tinted dark hero surface (`--color-destructive` tint at 20% over `--color-primary`).
- This is the ONLY page where the primary CTA (phone number) is styled as a `display-2` size element, not a standard button.
- Content sections are single-column urgency blocks — no decorative alternation or grid layouts.
- Cross-reference: [visual-differentiation-map.md](../visual-differentiation-map.md) entry `VD-EMRG-F6`

## Composition Guidance (HIGH latitude)

**Composition primitives:** `Surface` + `Stack` + `Frame` + `Cluster` + `Reveal`

**Hero:** `Surface(dark)` with subtle red tint (`--color-destructive` at 12% overlay). NO background media. Centered layout. Emergency eyebrow label ("24/7 Emergency Service"). Large headline. `brand.phone` as `display-2` text with `--color-accent` color and phone icon (20×20). Subhead with response time. CTA row: phone (primary, large) + short form link (secondary).

**No hero slider, no aerial photo, no editorial split.**

**Scenario section:** `Surface(dark)` — list of emergency scenarios (active leak, wind damage, storm impact, structural damage, ice dam, fallen tree). Icon + label `Cluster`. Visually heavy icon treatment (24×24 outline icons, `--color-accent` tint).

**Safety tips section:** Light `Surface`. "While you wait for our team" — numbered list of safety actions. Calm `Surface(inset)` styling, not alarming.

**Insurance assistance:** `Surface(light)`. Brief note on insurance claim documentation. Trust-forward, not salesy.

**Testimonials:** `Surface(light-inset)`. 2–3 emergency testimonials — brief, real names, area served.

**FAQ accordion:** Emergency-specific questions. Light `Surface`.

**Final CTA band:** `Surface(dark)` — large phone number repeated. Address below. Hours confirmation. Minimal — no decorative elements.

## Section Blueprint (E2E)

1. `emergency_hero_call_first`: Purpose: immediate action. Draft copy: "Storm Hit. We're Coming." + 24/7 subhead + large phone CTA. Layout: centered dark-red hero.
2. `emergency_scenarios`: Purpose: help users self-identify urgency. Draft copy: active leak, storm impact, fallen debris, structural risk list. Layout: icon-led single-column blocks.
3. `while_you_wait`: Purpose: reduce harm before crew arrival. Draft copy: safety tip steps in calm language. Layout: light instructional panel.
4. `insurance_help`: Purpose: administrative reassurance. Draft copy: claim documentation and coordination summary. Layout: concise support strip.
5. `emergency_proof`: Purpose: trust under pressure. Draft copy: brief emergency testimonials + trust badges. Layout: light inset section.
6. `emergency_faq`: Purpose: resolve last-minute objections. Draft copy: emergency-specific FAQ items. Layout: accordion stack.
7. `final_call_band`: Purpose: zero-friction conversion repeat. Draft copy: repeated phone CTA and hours. Layout: dark closing band.

## Motion

**CTAs only use `alive-energetic`:**
- Phone CTA in hero: subtle scale pulse every 4s (scale 1→1.02→1, `--motion-duration-fast`, `ease-out`), reduced-motion: no pulse.
- All other content sections: `calm-precise` `Reveal` on scroll, standard 60ms stagger.
- Reduced-motion: no pulse, instant reveals.

**Forbidden motion:** No flashing/blinking effects. No urgency-based animation loops (≠ the phone pulse which is calm, not alarming).

---

## State Requirements

| State | Handling |
|-------|---------|
| Testimonials loading/error | Gracefully hidden — phone CTA always shows |
| FAQ error | Static fallback FAQ array |
| Dark/light theme | Red-tinted hero preserves red tint in dark mode (no change needed — already dark) |

---

## Responsive Intent

- Mobile: phone number is the FIRST thing visible after the eyebrow. Large `display-1` on mobile. No information before the phone CTA. Sections below the fold for supporting content.
- Tablet: same priority — phone first.
- Desktop: centered layout, max-width `container-standard`.

---

## SEO

- Title: `seo.service_emergency_title`
- Description: `seo.service_emergency_description`
- Schema.org: `Service` (serviceType: "Emergency Roof Repair", availableChannel: 24/7 phone, provider: LocalBusiness)
- Canonical: `/services/emergency-repair`
- Internal links: `/services/roof-repair`, `/contact`, `/quote`

---

## Conversion Path

- Hero phone CTA → immediate call
- Hero secondary → short quote form (inline, 3 fields)
- Final band phone CTA → call (redundant, high-scroll recovery)
- "Non-emergency?" → `/services/roof-repair`

---

## Accessibility

- H1: `service.emergency.hero.heading`
- Phone CTA: `<a href="tel:+1XXXXXXXXXX">` with `aria-label="Call Apex Roofing emergency line"`
- Phone pulse animation: controlled by `useReducedMotion()` — disabled when preferred
- Scenario icons: `aria-hidden="true"`, text label carries meaning
- FAQ accordion: `aria-expanded` state, keyboard navigable

---

## Performance

- No hero image — LCP is text (fastest possible)
- No lazy-loaded above-fold content
- Minimal JS — phone CTA is a plain `<a>`, no hydration needed
- LCP target: ≤ 1.5s (text-only hero)
