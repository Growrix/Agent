## Content Tone Guidelines

- Lead with locality and outcome: "Serving [Metro] since [year]" not "We are a roofing company"
- Use plain, confident language — the tone of a skilled tradesperson who knows their work speaks for itself
- Urgency-aware: emergency copy uses direct, active phrasing without manufactured panic
- Length discipline: hero headlines ≤ 8 words primary, ≤ 18 words secondary. Body paragraphs ≤ 60 words.
- Forbidden: generic superlatives ("the best roofer in..."), unverifiable claims, corporate filler
